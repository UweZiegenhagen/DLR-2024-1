  abstract     = {In this paper we extend previous hydrodynamic equations, governing the motion of Bose-Einstein-condensed fluids, to include temperature effects. This allows us to analyze some differences between a normal fluid and a Bose-Einstein-condensed one. We show that, in close analogy with superfluid He-4, a Bose-Einstein-condensed fluid exhibits the mechanocaloric and thermomechanical effects. In our approach we can explain both effects without using the hypothesis that the Bose-Einstein-condensed fluid has zero entropy. Such ideas could be investigated in existing experiments.},

A simple condition for the occurrence of Bose-Einstein condensation can be given if we adopt generalized $\zeta$-functions to define the quantum theory. We show that the crucial feature governing Bose-Einstein condensation is the dimension $q$ associated with the continuous part of the eigenvalue spectrum of the Hamiltonian for nonrelativistic systems or the spatial part of the Klein-Gordon operator for relativistic systems. In either case Bose-Einstein condensation can only occur if $q\ge3$.},

  abstract     = {With the linear sigma model, we have studied Bose-Einstein condensation and the chiral phase transition in the chiral limit for an interacting pion system. A $\mu-T$ phase diagram including these two phenomena is presented. It is found that the phase plane has been divided into three areas: the Bose-Einstein condensation area, the chiral symmetry broken phase area and the chiral symmetry restored phase area. Bose-Einstein condensation can happen either from the chiral symmetry broken phase or from the restored phase. We show that the onset of the chiral phase transition is restricted in the area where there is no Bose-Einstein condensation.},
